        <h1>Homebrew</h1>
        
        <div class="brew">
        Ideas to change Dnd 5e/ general dm ideas.
        </div>
    
        <h2>Defense and Armor</h2>
    <div class="brew">
        Roll for defense instead of enemy rolling attack? like GLOB or numenera.
         I'd like some form of this idea to make the gm roll less and make enemy turns less boring.
        (DC12+monsterlvl or 3x monster level)
        glob: armor gives +1/2 to defense rolls 3 pieces or armor max 
        could be seen as light medium heavy (another option is: defense bonus = AC-12)
        can choose to use defense bonus from armor or dexbonus. critical dodge success allows you to make an attack or combat maneuver(push, move, etc) 
    <br><br>
        A lot of systems try to seperate dmg resistance and dodging, so that armor is more intuitive. I don't think this works out that well, ends up with more rolling just for a tiny bit less suspension of disbelief.
    <br><br>    
        
        Heavy armor doesn't ALWAYS give disadvantage on stealth checks. Just harder to move silently or hide without cover.
        Swimming: light/no armor, can swim in normal circumstances. Medium armor, make strength check. Heavy armor, you sink. 
    </div>

    
        <h2>Crit Tables</h2>
    
        <div class="brew">
        Use Crit Tables that change depending on class/level.
        Much like the <a href="crit.html">DCC Crit Tables</a>.
        </div>
    
        <h2>I search the body table</h2>
        <div class="brew">
        D100
        1-50 money
        51-75 common item
        76-100 unique-anytime one is rolled, replace table entry with different item.
        </div>
        
        <h2>Misc</h2>
    
    <div class="brew">
        <h4>Fumble Tables</h4>
    For when you roll a 1. Maybe split magic school/melee. From experience it's hard to find the sweetspot between boring wastes of time and fumbles that are too harsh because 5e feels very forgiving its jarring to have one mechanic thats very lethal. On the other hand enemies could fumble too. Probably wouldn't use this.
    <br><br>
        <h4>Anti HP Bloat</h4>
    Limit Hp somehow? maxes at lvl5, or gain hp every other level. or max is 5x class hit die or something. (might not work with current multiattack/ spellcasting enemies)
    <br><br>
        <h4>Wealth</h4>
    From numenera: Wealth. Wealth levels replace coins, at least for small-medium things. GM will simply say you can afford any 6 items from the basic item list. Or you can afford a stay at the mid-range inn and have a meal. (basically how i play dnd already since i often don’t remove copper or low silver. But later on if you’re quite wealthy you may ignore any cost under x gold). Alternatively: if you have 50 gold, you ignore all copper costs. If you have 500 gold you ignore all silver. (within reason you can't buy infinity items and then resell or something)
            <br><br>
    Carrying treasure: when you find a ton of gold or something big you can carry it but it’ll occupy your hand. May make for a fun escape.
