Starts in a smallish world, the first or second dungeon will have greater world open up. The smaller world is inside of a sphere. (the outside might be a different time of day. and the phere has some graffiti on it in a weird language..with maybe one familiar word)the mini world is inside of a sphere in a mountainous area. area around is patrolled by giants (mechs).<br>

            theyre unpredictable, the first time the party sees one it's idling, but sometimes they are hellbent on killing any passers by. but further out there are other settlements and even cities...also some other spheres and cubes. (basically a mostly wilderness overworld and Insular worlds connected by an underground megadungeon). The underground will be more fantasy, strange creatures, gold, swords etc. etc. The outside world is more dangerous and has more scifi.
            <br><br>
            As isolated worlds get discovered they might develop a similar dungeon-economy. Trading in treasures found below and technology outside.

        <div class="brew">
The Emperor ruled the whole realm but his son was weak and the provices stopped respecting him. The Shōdo took over the capital during his old age. He was stolen away by the O-mawashi in a daring escape. Old and wounded he is kept alive(or is he?) by a an artifact...a pool of dark liquid that he can't leave. He's still incompetent and only symbolically rules side 2. side 1 claims hes died and side 2 is dishonoring his corpse. side 1 still rules the capitol using the young son of the emperor as a puppet.

The Two rival kingdoms: The Shōdo have recently unlocked some secret from the past (maybe some severed mech arm or head) or: <br>

            Shōdo got the tech from a rogue member of higher race whos helping them. Ruled by youngish Lord (Nobunaga type) that dominates emperors son. The strange advisor looks quite weird like a fucked up squidface guy.<br>

            Others of his race look very different,they can apparently look like anything. theres actually only a small number of them..13..20? immortal.<br>
            <br>

The O-mawashi, the southern kingdom. They used to live in a more mountainous region, more craters overlapping creating ridges and cliffs. Now live on a cityships in the Sea. They actually planned to leave the realm but found that the world ends in the middle of the ocean. Ruled by dissapointing Lord, whose father was great.

The O-mawashi are working together with mutants, mecenaries, barbarians, anyone. Also working with a cult that uses strange magicks, leader of the O-mawashi will slowly become more strange as hes affected by rituals and enchantments. blackened skin...unmoving..great effort in both kingdoms to research artifacts. similar to japan making firearms.
<br><br>
Shōdo has slowed down after a huge surge due to internal troubles. rival shoguns. also strange events..ancient superhumans trying to get technology away from them. (immortal infertile elfin posthumans..some physical some as brains in robots..the advisor immortal actually gave tech to them out of boredom).

<h2 id="h22">Kingdom player long-term quests</h2>
<div class="brew">
The Shōdo might use players to find a bomb that could end the war, most skilled servants are related to one noble or other, cannot be trusted. or...its such a longshot they dont want to go..or its a lie and they sent many but they all died.
<br><br>
O-mawashi: Sends players to wasteland where there are rumours by scouts of giants seen in the distance. To enlist their help or at least steal their wonders. the giant robots (look like greek hoplite mechs) are found crouching in a circle conversing. they were protectrors of a lost people. now only giving eachother status updates.theyre unwilling to help, except for one! outside the circle, that can be persuaded.
<br><br>
he will take the visitors on his back and return to the realm. smoke in the distance, The Shōdo launched a major offensive. you see armies rolling like a black fog on the mountainside. the robot charges for a moment and then fires rear jets blasting into the fray straigt at the enemies super weapon. big old fight.
<br><br>
alternatively can help the villagers. just avoiding effects of war(draft, soldiers taking supplies, deserters ravaging crops), maybe brokering peace. getting defensive tech for em. or...poisoning battlefield to decimate armies. or assassinating generals. that kind of thing.
<br><br>
tempt players to join both sides. maybe one side by a mutant guy and the other by a harsh but effective lieutenant.
<br><br>
Or a third, maybe later option would be to help the immortals..get rid of the tech from The Shōdo.
