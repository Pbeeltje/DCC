<br><br>
<p>1</p>	Charge! Monsters attack. They want to eat the PCs, take all their stuff and/or sell them as slaves. If the monsters know that they are clearly inferior, they will flee instead.<br>
<p>2</p>	Ambush! Monsters attack with stealth and/or trickery. Goblins will disguise themselves as children (badly), a bear might hide in the cupboard. Treat this as 1 for dumb monsters.<br>
<p>3</p>	Hit and run! Monsters attack, then they gtfo unless they have great initial success. They might try to grab something/someone.<br>
<p>4</p>	Show of dominance: Monsters beat their drums, wave their spears and/or sprinkle the PCs with urine. Monsters wants the PCs to kowtow, give them treasure and/or do their bidding.<br>
<p>5</p>	Defend territory: Monsters makes it clear that this room/corridor is theirs and that the PCs should go another way. Bribery and/or flattery might work.<br>
<p>6</p>	Nature: Monster does something typical for its nature. Orcs charge without much tactics, trolls ask riddles, wizards meddle in the affairs of mortals.<br>
<p>7</p>	Trade: Monsters have X, wants to trade it for something the PCs have (food, gold, henchmen, etc.). Dumb monsters might make stupid trades. Proud monsters will take refusal to trade as an insult.<br>
<p>8</p>	Quest: Monsters needs the PCs to find something or fight someone. Monsters will offer help and/or a reward, but might not pay when push comes to show. Powerful monsters will use geas.<br>
