        <div class="brew">
<h4>Race/ Class</h4>
DCC uses Race-as class. Which basically means that demi-human racial differences and cultural differences are integrated into a class. In DCC when you make a character you first roll on the occupation table <a href="https://purplesorcerer.com/create_party.php">(lvl0 character creator)</a>. A little over 60% of the occupations are human, at lvl1 those wil be able to choose a class. For the others the class is set. The races will be used as-is except for the halfling, who is a little hairy lad instead(with alternative occupations). Below is some lore on how demi-humans fit into the world.<br><br>

<h4>Humans, Nobility and Peasantry</h4>
Humans rule. Most people are humans. Humans can generally be placed in the following class structure (in order of respect):<br><br>

Nobles<br>
Administrators<br>
Warriors<br>
Middle class: Craftsmen, Guards, Innkeepers<br>
Farmers<br>
Merchants (seen as leeches therefore below farmers)<br>
Drifters<br>

<h4>Dwarves, Shocktroops and Artisans</h4>
A long time ago, <b>Dwarves were created as a servant race by the Elves.</b> They turned on the Elves and conquered them alongside the humans. Dwarves now live among humans. Generally not overly ambitious or intelligent, they are happy to serve. They occupy their own caste in soceity focussing on either crafts or soldiery. Army divisions have Dwarven attachment forces that suffer the brunt of the casualties.
Their origins are only vaguely remembered(except by the elves), out of shame of their origins or maybe pride of freeing themselves from the Elves over the ages dwarves have started writing their own origin myths(spawned from stone, descended from giants etc), these are widely believed among Dwarves.<br>
<b>Dwarves care a great deal about shields</b>, families have ancestral shields(1 or more) that are handed down the male line. Younger sons or outcasts have shameful crappy shields.<br>

<h4>Elves, Fallen Decadent and Strange Civilization, living in servitude</h4>
Elves don't believe they were overthrown by the other races, rather that they fell due to their own hubris. <b>Most of them feel they lost the right to rule</b> and are happy living in the shadow of man.<br>
<b>Elves are completely sex-less</b>, some may look more like a man or a woman from a human perspective.<br>
<b>Occupations:</b> The effaminate elves mostly function as courtiers, courtisanes (fancy prostitutes), advisors and artists. Some Elves live like drifters in the wild.<br>
Elves are feared and respected by commoners, not because they're really dangerous in daily life (if they do get bullied or attacked they're not likely to resist) but because they're likely to occupy important stations in society(close to power but never in power) and because of their inscrutable aura.

Elves sometimes have irregur skin-tones. Commoners believe Elves get together at night and consort with devils. <br>

<h4>Monkeys</h4>
Monkeys occupy a special place on society. They're seen as untouchables, commoners are not allowed to hurt them. They're also seen as very good luck! They are not expected to do any work, they live on offerings. Monkey's are often lazy. Ambitious monkey's are rare but some have been able to exploit their holy status to obtain power and luxury.

There are many different kinds of monkeys, macaces, tamarins baboons(mean) etc.

       <h2>History</h2>
        <div class="brew">
<b>Ancient</b><br>
Elves once ruled the land. It was a time of great magicks!
  <br><br>

<b>Modern</b><br>
The Emperial line ruled the whole realm but the current Emperor has lost the respect of his subordinate lords in his old age. He spent his time consorting with Elves. The Shōdo clan took over the capital during his old age. He was stolen away by the O-mawashi clan in a daring escape. He's nominally still the emperor but has not made any public appearances. The Shōdo claim he has died and the O-mawashi are dishonoring his corpse. The Shōdo still rule the capitol using the young son of the emperor as a puppet. The sides had until recently been evenly matched and the realm was peaceful..
