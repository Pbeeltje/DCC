        <h2>Silver for XP</h2>
        <div class="brew">
          <img src="coinss.png"> <br>
        You gain XP by collecting treasure. What this should do is align player and character motivations a bit and also affect how you manage your inventory.
        <li>One silver equals 1 XP
        <li>1 Gold = 10 Silver = 100 Copper
        <li>Silver is converted into XP when you return to Town or a place that might stand in for a Town.
        <li>XP is always shared equally, regardless of who has the treasure.
        <li>Valuables like gems or jewelry don't need to be converted and their value is added to xp as if it were coin.
        <li>Magical treasure doesn't give XP unless you convert it to currency by selling it.
        <li>Killing monsters also gives a little bit of xp, 10 x their HD.
        <li>Might also be able to gain xp during downtime by doing activities that involve spending lots of cash.
        <br><br>
        All Classes gain levels at the same rate: <br>

        <h2 >Inventory and Encumbrance</h2>
        <div class="brew">

<h4>Inventory</h4>
Since this campaign will be focused on treasure and exploration. It needs some kind of inventory and encumbrance! It will use a simple inventory slot system: <br><br>

Inventory slots = Strength

All items take up 1 slot, except:
            <ul>
                <li>Large weapons are 2.</li>
                <li>Armor is half of ac bonus rounded down. (so padded=0, leather =1 etc.)</li>
                <li>Bundles ie throwing weapon/ torch/ ration(day) 3 for 1 slot</li>
                <li>Arrows/Bolts/Stones 10 for 1</li>
                <li>100 coins(any kind) 1 slot</li>
                <li>items like backpacks give more slots</li>
                </ul>

An easy way to put this on a sheet is one line per slot: <br><br>

            ~~10 str boy inventory (without backpacks etc.)~~<br>
        <i>    <pre class=inventory>
1- Leather armor
2- Greatsword of Hans
3- *Greatsword of Hans (Same Sword)
4- 100 gold (100)
5- 10 silver, 50 copper, 5 gold (65/100)
6- 3/3 torches
7- 3/3 rations
8- orc head
9- open
10-open
Free Stuff (rings, worn clothes, chalk, etc)
</pre></i>



            <h4>Encumbrance</h4>
If you go over your slot limit you're encumbered, <b>-5' movespeed</b>, <b>-2 ac</b> and <b>+5 to fumble rolls</b>. Can't jump or swim(normally).<br><br>

If you exceed your limit by <b>more than 5 you cannot move.</b>
<br><br>

<h4>Exhaustion</h4>
You gain exhaustion like in 5e, but! you just add exhaustion to your inventory taking up 2 slots. hehehe. <br><br>

<a target="_blank" href="treasure.jpg">
    <img id="thumb" src="treasure.jpg"></a>

</div>

<br><br>
       <h2>Weapons and Armor</h2>
       <div class="brew">
         This should replace the armor and weapon tables in the DCC manual. Prices or availability not guaranteed.<br><br>
        <img src="weaponsarmor.jpg">
       </div>

 <br><br>
        <h2 >Death and Injury</h2>
        <div class="brew">

When you reach 0 HP you will be disabled and have to roll on the Injury table! You lose one point of Stamina permanently regardless of injury plus whatever effects the injury may have. <br> Afterwards <b>you will survive for a number of rounds equal to your level</b> (1 round at lvl1 and 3 at lvl3 and so on). <br><br>

<h4>Injury Table</h4>

<img id="thumb" src="injurytable.jpg"> <br><br>

            <a target="_blank" href="injury1.jpg">
<img id="thumb" src="injury1.jpg"></a>
            <a target="_blank" href="injury2.jpg">
<img id="thumb" src="injury2.jpg"></a>
            <a target="_blank" href="injury3.jpg">
<img id="thumb" src="injury3.jpg"></a>
            <a target="_blank" href="injury4.jpg">
<img id="thumb" src="injury4.jpg"></a>
        <br><br>
Where injury has a side:
Cause Damage, <b>even = right  uneven = left.</b>
<br><br>
<h4>Instant Death</h4>
In some cases you might forgo the injury table entirely: <br>
           <b> 1. you take more than your max HP of damage at once <br>
            2. at DMs discretion</b>

</div>

<h2 >Little Combat Stuff</h2>
<div class="brew">
<h4>Firing into Melee</h4>
If you fire a ranged weapon into a group of characters enganged in melee you should make sure to hit!<br>
If you miss, <b>your shot will target a random other creature in the melee.</b> The to hit for the attack will be the <b>opposite of your roll (20- your roll, no mods applied).</b> <br>
So if you roll a natural 4 and miss, the shot will count as a 16(20-4) to hit a different target. This way near misses aren't that dangerous and skilled archers are less likely to hit friendlies.
<br><br>
<h4>Melee into Grapplers</h4>
The exact same principle will apply to hitting a target that's being grappled. If you miss you might hit your ally! You do get +2 to attacking a grappled target.
<br><br>
<h4>Modifiers</h4>
Attacking a prone target/ out of range/ range up close will work basically like 5e. Simpler than DCC tbh. <br>
Otherwise I'll give Advantage/Disadvantage or +x modifiers when needed(stuff like high ground giving +1 to ranged fire or +2 to hitting a grappled foe).
