        <h2>Silver for XP</h2>
        <div class="brew">
          <img src="coinss.png"> <br>
        You gain XP by collecting treasure. What this should do is align player and character motivations a bit and also affect how you manage your inventory.
        <li>One silver equals 1 XP
        <li>1 Gold = 10 Silver = 100 Copper
        <li>Silver is converted into XP when you return to Town or a place that might stand in for a Town.
        <li>XP is always shared equally, regardless of who has the treasure.
        <li>Valuables like gems or jewelry don't need to be converted and their value is added to xp as if it were coin.
        <li>Magical treasure doesn't give XP unless you convert it to currency by selling it.
        <li>Killing monsters also gives a little bit of xp, 10 x their HD.
        <li>Might also be able to gain xp during downtime by doing activities that involve spending lots of cash.
        <br><br>
        All Classes gain levels at the same rate: <br>

        <h2 >Inventory and Encumbrance</h2>
        <div class="brew">

<h4>Inventory</h4>
Since this campaign will be focused on treasure and exploration. It needs some kind of inventory and encumbrance! It will use a simple inventory slot system: <br><br>

Inventory slots = Strength

All items take up 1 slot, except:
            <ul>
                <li>Large weapons are 2.</li>
                <li>Armor is half of ac bonus rounded down. (so padded=0, leather =1 etc.)</li>
                <li>Bundles ie throwing weapon/ torch/ ration(day) 3 for 1 slot</li>
                <li>Arrows/Bolts/Stones 10 for 1</li>
                <li>100 coins(any kind) 1 slot</li>
                <li>Pouch for random things (o slots itself, holds 10 slots of small stuff like a diamond or a ring)</li>
                <li>items like backpacks give more slots</li>
                </ul>

An easy way to put this on a sheet is one line per slot: <br><br>

            ~~10 str boy inventory (without backpacks etc.)~~<br>
        <i>    <pre class=inventory>
1- Leather armor
2- Greatsword of Hans
3- *Greatsword of Hans (Same Sword)
4- 100 gold (100)
5- 10 silver, 50 copper, 5 gold (65/100)
6- 3/3 torches
7- 3/3 rations
8- orc head
9- Water Skin
10-open
Pouch(ring x, ring y, agate 3/10)
</pre></i>

            <h4>Readied Items</h4>
Not all of the items you carry are readily available for use in combat. Most will be in your pack or hidden away in your clothes.<br><br>
Readied Items are items you can use at any time. <b>Max Readied Item slots = half your STR</b>(rounded down).<br>
Finding and being ready to use any other item takes 1d4 rounds.
<br><br>


            <h4>Encumbrance</h4>
If you go over your slot limit you're encumbered, <b>-5' movespeed</b>, <b>-2 AC</b>, <b>Disadvantage on Reflex Saves</b> and <b>+5 to fumble rolls</b>. Can't jump, swim or climb(normally).<br><br>

If you exceed your limit by <b>4 or more you cannot move.</b>

       <h2>Survival</h2>
       <div class="brew">

         <h4>Rest and Exhaustion</h4>
         Rest takes 8 hours and does a few things: restores 1d6 hp and 1 point of missing ability score (relevant for spellburn etc.) also makes all spells available agian for wizard(that were lost on miscast) and halves dissaproval built up by clerics.<br>
         If you don't rest(or in some other situations) you gain exhaustion! Add 2 slots of exhaustion to your inventory. <br>
         <img src="deprived.jpg"> ---you can't always gain benefits from rest!
         <br><br>


         <!-- <h4> Food and drink</h4>
         You need to eat 3 rations/meals a day and drink one waterskin(under normal conditions).<br>
         You can <b>scavenge and hunt</b> while on the road, your location will determine what can be found. You can also <b>butcher</b> (HP of creature in rations, many monsters are mostly or entirely inedible but you're free to try of course!).<br>
         Normal rations go bad in a week, Iron rations(salted, smoked etc) don't go bad. (will probably only track this in specific situations like if you slaughter a massive deer or travel extremely far).<br><br>

         PENALTIES: 2 exhaustion per day being underfed.
         <br><br>
         I don't think this will be a very wilderness focused campaign. Expect the occasional several day trip, shouldn't be a huge task to manage.

       <h2>Weapons and Armor</h2>
       <div class="brew">
         This should replace the armor and weapon tables in the DCC manual. Prices or availability not guaranteed.<br><br>
        <img src="weaponsarmor.jpg">
       </div>

 <br><br>
        <h2 >Death and Injury</h2>
        <div class="brew">

When you reach 0 HP you will be disabled and have to roll on the Injury table! You lose one point of Stamina permanently regardless of injury plus whatever effects the injury may have. <br> Afterwards <b>you will survive for a number of rounds equal to your level</b> (1 round at lvl1 and 3 at lvl3 and so on). <br><br>

<h4>Injury Table</h4>

<img id="thumb" src="injurytable.jpg"> <br><br>

            <a target="_blank" href="injury1.jpg">
<img id="thumb" src="injury1.jpg"></a>
            <a target="_blank" href="injury2.jpg">
<img id="thumb" src="injury2.jpg"></a>
            <a target="_blank" href="injury3.jpg">
<img id="thumb" src="injury3.jpg"></a>
            <a target="_blank" href="injury4.jpg">
<img id="thumb" src="injury4.jpg"></a>
        <br><br>
Where injury has a side:
Cause Damage, <b>even = right  uneven = left.</b>
<br><br>
<h4>Instant Death</h4>
In some cases you might forgo the injury table entirely: <br>
           <b> 1. you take more than your max HP of damage at once <br>
            2. at DMs discretion</b>

<h2>Downtime</h2>
<div class="brew">
WIP
</div>

<h2 >Little Combat Stuff</h2>
<div class="brew">
<h4>Firing into Melee</h4>
If you fire a ranged weapon into a group of characters enganged in melee you should make sure to hit!<br>
If you miss, <b>your shot will target a random other creature in the melee.</b> The to hit for the attack will be the <b>opposite of your roll (20- your roll, no mods applied).</b> <br>
So if you roll a natural 4 and miss, the shot will count as a 16(20-4) to hit a different target. This way near misses aren't that dangerous and skilled archers are less likely to hit friendlies.
<br><br>
<h4>Melee into Grapplers</h4>
The exact same principle will apply to hitting a target that's being grappled. If you miss you might hit your ally! You do get +2 to attacking a grappled target.
<br><br>
<h4>Modifiers</h4>
Attacking a prone target/ out of range/ range up close will work basically like 5e. Simpler than DCC tbh. <br>
Otherwise I'll give Advantage/Disadvantage or +x modifiers when needed(stuff like high ground giving +1 to ranged fire or +2 to hitting a grappled foe).
